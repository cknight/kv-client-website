# Viewing values

You can view your KV key and value entries via either the `Get` or `List`
interfaces. `Get` will show you the value immediately while `List` will show you
a preview of the value in a table below the list criteria after execution. You
can see the full value by either hovering over the row or clicking on the row.
This will launch the key/value editor. Within the key value editor will be the
original value in full. If the value is of type 'string' but contains JSON
content you may also be presented with the option to preview the value as
formatted JSON (if it isn't formatted already). Selecting this preview will
auto-format your JSON, but will not actually change the value at all.
