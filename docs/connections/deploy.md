# Deploy

Deploy connections are for all projects hosted in Deno Deploy. To establish
these connections you will need an access token from the Deploy dashboard. You
can create a new access token in the `Settings` tab in Deploy under
`Access Tokens`. Once you have an access token, you can connect KV Client to
Deploy KV databases, which auto-populate the connections. Deploy connections are
user specific and are not shared with any other user.
