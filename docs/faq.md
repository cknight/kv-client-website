# Frequently asked questions

### How do I get all data in my database?

You can access all data (for delete/copy/filter) by using the `list` interface and leaving the prefix, start and end keys blank.

### How can I delete all data in my database?

First `list` all data in your database (see previous question) and then choose `Delete xxx results` where 'xxx' is the number of entries it downloaded.  Note that the `Delete xxx results` will delete all those specific entries.  Any entries added after the `list` will remain in KV.

### How do I search for a specific value or part of a value?

After you `list` your data (either all data or a subset you wish to search), you can use the `Filter` in the results section as a free text search of your results.  Note that the filter only applies to results.  If you did not `list` all data then the filter won't search all data.
